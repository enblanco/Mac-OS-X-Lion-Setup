# OSX Custom Setup
Currently curated for an **OSX 10.9 Mavericks** fresh install

## Why?

I'm lazy and tend to be very picky on what (and how) to install things on my OS. Automating the process seems a good way to keep things under control and learn some new things..

I'll try to maintain this as:
- A step by step guide after a fresh install
- My research into osx hidden settings (and useful configs)
 

## Use:
By now, after a fresh install just download and run `setup.sh` after making sure everything is up to date.
